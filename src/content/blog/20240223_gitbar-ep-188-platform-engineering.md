In recent times, the term Platform Engineering has gained increasing attention. But what exactly does this term mean? In this episode, we will delve deep into this new methodology, examining its key aspects. What is an IDP (Internal Developer Platform), and what are the advantages of using it? Together, we will discover how this internal development tool can enable a reduction in manual and repetitive operations. We'll explore how this methodology can accelerate development timelines and enhance Developer Experience (DX). Furthermore, having everything consolidated in one place can improve project governance, bringing benefits not only for developers but also for operations, ops, SRE, and other roles. We will analyze how DevOps teams, SREs, and Platform teams can collaborate and interact, building a collaboration based on abstraction, automation, and self-provisioning with the aim of allowing everyone (Dev, Ops, Platform) to "forget" about recurring (and tedious) problems and instead focus on what is most important and valuable.
