description: "Measuring someone's productivity in the execution of a specific task is of fundamental importance for optimizing the activity itself. Productivity has always been considered in quantitative terms since the early theories of Scientific Management in 1911, but in the era of 'Knowledge Workers', these paradigms must necessarily evolve.
Let's explore the aspects to consider when evaluating the developers' performance in this new productive context."

> ##### Challenging traditional productivity metrics in software development, I highlight the complexities posed by the creative and human-centric nature of the field. Drawing on the limitations of Scientific Management principles, I argue for a shift towards qualitative metrics that consider the multifaceted aspects of productivity in this dynamic domain, ultimately advocating for a holistic approach that values creativity and humanity over rigid quantitative measurements.

Often, adopting a tool or framework leads to the expectation of assessing a single metric indicating whether our team's productivity has increased or decreased. Unfortunately, it's not that simple; software engineering is an extremely complex and uncertain activity. The entire discussion around developers' productivity can be summarized by two main points that differentiate software development activity from all others.

## Software development is a complex and creative handavor

The very essence of engineering implies a creative effort directed at finding innovative solutions to complex problems. While not all problems are intricate, and not all solutions are innovative, applying known solutions to easily resolved issues falls outside the realm of engineering.

Software engineering is neither a linear nor a predictable activity. In cases where it becomes so, it is deemed 'boilerplate', prompting efforts to automate these tasks. This stands in contrast to activities like molding machine parts or coal mining, where an increase in labor often results with an increase in production—an occurrence not mirrored in software engineering.

Moreover, it's crucial to acknowledge that software engineering is not algorithmic. While general processes and best practices exist, engineers adapt them to the specific problem, exploring alternative paths when necessary. Additionally, the output of development activities is not always clearly defined from the start and lacks uniformity or interchangeability. After all, not all programs are equal, and not all lines of code are equal.

Attempts to oversimplify the concept of engineering often lead to a failure to recognize its inherent complexity—a complex system that, when underestimated, results in evaluation errors that undermine the productivity measurement process for developers. There is a common confusion between throughput and productivity. In software development, producing more does not necessarily equate to being more productive. Unlike an industrial system like coal mining, where collecting twice the quantity leads to a 100% increase in productivity, in software engineering, writing twice the lines of code does not mean being doubly productive.

Software developers engage in a significant amount of cognitive work; problem-solving activities demand effort that may not immediately translate into an objective output but is crucial for reaching the final result.

## Developers are human

Software developers are, undeniably, human beings. Yet, there persists a tendency to perceive this group as non-human entities within a larger system.

To understand what makes developers more or less productive, it is crucial to grasp what makes human beings more or less productive. Considering the characteristics and limitations of decision-making processes, the intrinsic and accidental complexity of a specific task, the organizational and business context in which activities are carried out, and the environmental, cultural, and social context in which an individual operates are fundamental factors to be considered when evaluating the productivity of a software developer.

It is a common belief that 'human issues' fall under the purview of human resources, detached from the technical matters that concern engineering departments. What is often overlooked, however, is that addressing strictly technical problems frequently requires a profound understanding of the human decision-making process, while human issues, at times, can be approached by resorting to technical solutions.

## Change the paradigm

The software development process is strongly characterized by two essential dimensions: creativity and humanity. This distinctive nature makes measuring productivity within this context a complex endeavor.

When we analyze modern attempts to quantify and analyze worker productivity, we find ourselves revisiting the theories of Scientific Management formulated by Frederick Taylor in the distant year of 1911. These theories outline principles for measuring the productivity of workers engaged in manual and repetitive tasks, such as coal mining. In these theories, four key principles are identified:

1.  Don’t make guesses about efficiency and productivity; measure and evaluate them systematically.
2.  Select, train, and cultivate workers deliberately.
3.  Decompose work into tasks that can be delegated to workers (ideally, along organizational lines).
4.  Provide specific, prescriptive task instructions to each worker and monitor them to ensure they execute as directed.

While Taylor's approach seems accurate and agreeable, a careful analysis prompts us to question its applicability in the context of software engineering. There are no objections to the first two points: we study the productive processes of developers for the same reasons as productivity examinations of workers in that era, and through hiring processes, developers are selected and trained.

However, challenges arise with the third and fourth points. Decomposing a complex activity into simpler, parallelizable tasks is an engineering and organizational problem of considerable complexity, often exceeding the execution of the individual decomposed tasks. The fourth point presents a fundamental issue: nobody enjoys being confined to specific execution methods, particularly in a context like software engineering, where progress emerges through thinking and experimentation.

This approach necessitates the imposition of precise metrics for measuring individual productivity, creating friction and incurring costs in terms of productivity and resources, leaving developers dissatisfied. For these reasons, the scientific management approach is not suitable for evaluating the productivity of developers and knowledge workers more broadly. To assess their productivity effectively, a shift towards qualitative metrics is necessary, considering the highly complex nature of productivity in these contexts and accepting trade-offs. Thus, a holistic evaluation, taking into account all facets, is more appropriate than a reductionist and one-dimensional approach.
